				<h3>Space Jam remake set for 2016.</h3>
				<p>According to state and federal authorities, Swartz used JSTOR, 
				   a digital repository, to download a large number of academic 
				   journal articles through MIT's computer network over the course of a 
				   few weeks in late 2010 and early 2011. At the time, Swartz was a research 
				   fellow at Harvard University, which provided him with a JSTOR account.
				   Visitors to MIT's "open campus" were authorized to access JSTOR through 
				   its network.
				   The authorities said Swartz downloaded the documents through a laptop 
				   connected to a networking switch in a controlled-access wiring closet at MIT.
