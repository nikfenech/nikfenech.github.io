				This is an experiment with CSS to style
				a block of text and present it in an 
				interesting way.<br><br>
				But I must explain to you how all this 
				mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and 
				praising pain was born and I will give you 
				a complete account of the system, and expound 
				the actual teachings of the great explorer 
				of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. <br><br>
				No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure 
				itself, because it is pleasure, but because those 
				who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally 
				encounter consequences that are extremely painful. <br><br>
				Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or 
				desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, 
				but because occasionally circumstances occur in 
				which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. <br><br>
				To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious 
				physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? 
				But who has any right to find fault with a man who 
				chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying 
				consequences, or one who avoids a pain 
				that produces no resultant pleasure?
